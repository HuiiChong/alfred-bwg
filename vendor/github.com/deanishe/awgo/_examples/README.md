Examples
========

Each subdirectory contains a complete, but trivial, Alfred workflow demonstrating AwGo features.

After building the executable, copy or symlink the directory to Alfred's workflow directory to try it out.

You can use [this script][installer] to simplify installing/symlinking workflows that are still in development.

If you've installed that script on your `$PATH`, you can try out the examples by running:

```sh
workflow-install -s /path/to/example
```

which will symlink the workflow to Alfred's workflow directory.
