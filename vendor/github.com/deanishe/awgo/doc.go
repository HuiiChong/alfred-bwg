Package aw is a utility library/framework for Alfred 3 workflows
https://www.alfredapp.com/

It provides APIs for interacting with Alfred (e.g. Script Filter feedback) and
the workflow environment (variables, caches, settings).

NOTE: AwGo is currently in development. The API *will* change and should
not be considered stable until v1.0. Until then, vendoring AwGo (e.g.
with dep or vgo) is strongly recommended.

Be sure to also check out the _examples/ subdirectory, which contains
some simple, but complete, workflows that demonstrate the features
of AwGo and useful workflow idioms.


Features

As of AwGo 0.14, all applicable features of Alfred 3.6 are supported.

The main features are:

	- Simple access to workflow settings.
	- Fluent API for generating Alfred JSON.
	- Fuzzy filtering.
	- Simple, but powerful, API for caching/saving workflow data.
	- Run scripts and script code.
	- Call Alfred's AppleScript API from Go.
	- Read and write workflow settings from info.plist.
	- Workflow update API with built-in support for GitHub releases.
	- Pre-configured logging for easier debugging, with a rotated log file.
	- Catches panics, logs stack trace and shows user an error message.
	- "Magic" queries/actions for simplified development and user support.
	- Some default icons based on macOS system icons.


Usage

Typically, you'd call your program's main entry point via Run(). This way, the
library will rescue any panic, log the stack trace and show an error message to
the user in Alfred.

	// script_filter.go

	package main

	// Import name is "aw"
	import "github.com/deanishe/awgo"

	// aw.Workflow is the main API
	var wf *aw.Workflow

	func init() {
		// Create a new *Workflow using default configuration
		// (workflow settings are read from the environment variables
		// set by Alfred)
		wf = aw.New()
	}

	func main() {
		// Wrap your entry point with Run() to catch and log panics and
		// show an error in Alfred instead of silently dying
		wf.Run(run)
	}

	func run() {
		// Create a new item
		wf.NewItem("Hello World!")
		// And send the results to Alfred
		wf.SendFeedback()
	}


In the Script box (Language = "/bin/bash"):

	./script_filter


Script Filters

To generate results for Alfred to show in a Script Filter, use the feedback
API of Workflow:

	// Create new items
	NewItem()
	NewFileItem()
	NewWarningItem()

	// Sorting/filtering results
	Filter()

	// Send feedback to Alfred
	SendFeedback()

	// Warning/error calls that drop all other Items on the floor
	// and send feedback immediately
	Warn()
	WarnEmpty()
	Fatal()      // exits program
	Fatalf()     // exits program
	FatalError() // exits program

You can set workflow variables (via feedback) with Workflow.Var, Item.Var
and Modifier.Var.

See Workflow.SendFeedback for more documentation.


Run Script actions

Alfred requires a different JSON format if you wish to set workflow variables.

Use the ArgVars (named for its equivalent element in Alfred) struct to
generate output from Run Script actions.

Be sure to set TextErrors to true to prevent Workflow from generating
Alfred JSON if it catches a panic:

	wf.Configure(TextErrors(true))

See ArgVars for more information.


Configuration

New() creates a *Workflow using the default values and workflow settings
read from environment variables set by Alfred.

You can change defaults by passing one or more Options to New(). If
you do not want to use Alfred's environment variables, or they aren't set
(i.e. you're not running the code in Alfred), you must pass an Env as
the first Option to New() using CustomEnv().

A Workflow can be re-configured later using its Configure() method.

Check out the _examples/ subdirectory for some simple, but complete, workflows
which you can copy to get started.

See the documentation for Option for more information on configuring a Workflow.


Fuzzy filtering

AwGo can filter Script Filter feedback using a Sublime Text-like fuzzy
matching algorithm.

Workflow.Filter() sorts feedback Items against the provided query, removing
those that do not match.

Sorting is performed by subpackage fuzzy via the fuzzy.Sortable interface.

See _examples/fuzzy for a basic demonstration.

See _examples/bookmarks for a demonstration of implementing fuzzy.Sortable on
your own structs and customising the fuzzy sort settings.


Logging

AwGo automatically configures the default log package to write to STDERR
(Alfred's debugger) and a log file in the workflow's cache directory.

The log file is necessary because background processes aren't connected
to Alfred, so their output is only visible in the log. It is rotated when
it exceeds 1 MiB in size. One previous log is kept.

AwGo detects when Alfred's debugger is open (Workflow.Debug() returns true)
and in this case prepends filename:linenumber: to log messages.


Workflow settings

The Config struct (which is included in Workflow as Workflow.Config) provides an
interface to the workflow's settings from the Workflow Environment Variables panel.
https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/variables/#environment

Alfred exports these settings as environment variables, and you can read them
ad-hoc with the Config.Get*() methods, and save values back to Alfred with
Config.Set().

Using Config.To() and Config.From(), you can "bind" your own structs to the
settings in Alfred:

	// Options will be populated from workflow/environment variables
	type Options struct {
		Server   string `env:"HOSTNAME"`
		Port     int    // use default: PORT
		User     string `env:"USERNAME"`
		Password string `env:"-"` // ignore
	}

	cfg := NewConfig()
	opts := &Options{}

	// Populate Config's fields from the corresponding environment variables.
	if err := cfg.To(opts); err != nil {
		// handle error
	}

And to save a struct's fields to the workflow's settings in Alfred:

	// Defaults
	opts = &Options{
		Server:   "localhost",
		Port:     6000,
	}

	// Save Options to Alfred
	if err := cfg.From(opts); err != nil {
		// handle error
	}

See the documentation for Config.To and Config.From for more information,
and _examples/settings for a demo workflow based on the API.


Alfred actions

The Alfred struct provides methods for the rest of Alfred's AppleScript
API. Amongst other things, you can use it to tell Alfred to open, to search
for a query, or to browse/action files & directories.

See documentation of the Alfred struct for more information.


Storing data

AwGo provides a basic, but useful, API for loading and saving data.
In addition to reading/writing bytes and marshalling/unmarshalling to/from
JSON, the API can auto-refresh expired cache data.

See Cache and Session for the API documentation.

Workflow has three caches tied to different directories:

    Workflow.Data     // Cache pointing to workflow's data directory
    Workflow.Cache    // Cache pointing to workflow's cache directory
    Workflow.Session  // Session pointing to cache directory tied to session ID

These all share the same API. The difference is in when the data go away.

Data saved with Session are deleted after the user closes Alfred or starts
using a different workflow. The Cache directory is in a system cache
directory, so may be deleted by the system or "System Maintenance" tools.

The Data directory lives with Alfred's application data and would not
normally be deleted.

Scripts and background jobs

Subpackage util provides several functions for running script files and
snippets of AppleScript/JavaScript code. See util for documentation and
examples.

AwGo offers a simple API to start/stop background processes via Workflow's
RunInBackground(), IsRunning() and Kill() methods. This is useful for
running checks for updates and other jobs that hit the network or take a
significant amount of time to complete, allowing you to keep your Script
Filters extremely responsive.

See _examples/update and _examples/workflows for demonstrations of this API.
